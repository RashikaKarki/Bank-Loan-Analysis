# Bank Loan Analysis 

## Project Description
This is a project to prepare a report for a bank’s loan division. The answer that I am looking for is if a customer’s marital status, age, number of children and other such factors has an impact on whether they will default on a loan. The data has some record of a bank customers’ credit worthiness.

## Describing data
- children: the number of children in the family 
- days_employed: how long the customer has worked 
- dob_years: the customer’s age 
- education: the customer’s education level 
- education_id: identifier for the customer’s education 
- family_status: the customer’s marital status 
- family_status_id: identifier for the customer’s marital status 
- gender: the customer’s gender 
- income_type: the customer’s income type 
- debt: whether the client has ever defaulted on a loan 
- total_income: annual income 
- purpose: reason for taking out a loan
